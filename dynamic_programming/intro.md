DP
- systematically and efficiently explore all possible solutions.
- break down the problem into "overlapping subproblems"
- optimal substructure


Bottom-up (tabulation)
- iteration with base cases
	e.g. Fibonacci -> use F(0) and F(1) to calculate F(2)
- usually faster; iteration doesn't have the overhead
Top-down (memoization)
- recursion with memoization
	e.g. store (hashmap) the result and use it later
